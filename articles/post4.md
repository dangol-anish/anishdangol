## Why Budgeting Matters for Students

As a student, you're likely living on a tight budgetâ€”between tuition, books, and living costs, your income may not stretch far.

Budgeting helps you:

- Avoid unnecessary debt
- Save for emergencies or future plans
- Gain control over your money habits
- Build long-term financial literacy

## Step 1: Track Your Expenses

Start by recording **every cent you spend** for one month. Use:

- A notebook
- Notes app
- Spreadsheet
- Expense-tracking app

The goal is to see where your money goesâ€”without judgment.

## Step 2: Categorize Your Spending

Once you have your expense list, divide it into three key categories:

### Needs

These are your essentials for survival and academic success.

| Expense          | Amount   |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Rent             | $600     |
| Groceries        | $200     |
| Transportation   | $60      |
| Utilities        | $50      |
| Internet & Phone | $50      |
| **Total**        | **$960** |

### Wants

Non-essential but enjoyable expenses.

- Streaming services (Netflix, Spotify)
- Gaming
- Dining out
- Clothes & accessories
- Subscriptions

### Savings

Donâ€™t skip thisâ€”even a small amount matters!

- Emergency fund
- Holiday fund
- Travel or study abroad savings
- Retirement (yes, it's not too early)

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Try saving 10% of any income or allowance you receive.

---

## Step 3: Set a Realistic Budget

Use your categorized list to set limits for each area.

A simple rule is the **50/30/20 rule**:

- **50%** â†’ Needs
- **30%** â†’ Wants
- **20%** â†’ Savings

Customize it based on your situation. If you're not paying rent (e.g. living with family), adjust accordingly.
