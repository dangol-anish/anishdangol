      I am a software engineer, ui/ux designer, product planner, problem solver,
      mentor, forever student, minimalist, and eternal optimist. I love to both
      build and break things. I am motivated by challenging projects with
      self-guided research and dynamic problem solving. My true passion is
      crafting creative front end designs with unique takes on color, typography
      and motion. This is my personal space, where I share my work and projects.
      I also write interactive blog posts about engineering and design.
